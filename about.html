                <p>
                    I am an aspiring Computer Scientist hoping to work 
                    in the areas of Machine Learning, Theoretical Computer Science,
                    Algorithms and Bioinformatics. I am currently focused on learning
                    more about these areas and learning about other Computer Science and 
                    Mathematics topics.
